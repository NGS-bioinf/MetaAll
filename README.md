# MetaDone
MetaDone is a collection of different workflows that enable integrated metagenomic analysis of short PE (e.g. Illumina) and long (e.g. Oxford Nanopore Technologies) reads. Three approaches are used for pathogen detection: taxonomic classification of reads, taxonomic classification of contigs and mapping to reference genomes.
## Installation & Dependencies
To access the scripts, clone the depository: 
### Obtain the required databases
### Build Singularity images
## Example of use
### Short PE read/contig classification
### Short PE read reference genome alignment
### Long read/contig classification
### Long read reference genome alignment
